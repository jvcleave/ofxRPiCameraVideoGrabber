#### STATUS: DEPRECATED, See [ofxOMXCamera](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXCamera) for future development/releases

Master may be unstable, features untested. See [Releases](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxRPiCameraVideoGrabber/releases) for tested versions

#### DESCRIPTION:   
openFrameworks addon to control the Raspberry Pi Camera Module. This does _not_ provide still camera functionality.


#### REQUIREMENTS:
openFrameworks .9 or higher [Setup Guide](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/)   
Developed with GPU memory set at 256, overclock to medium but 128/default should work as well   
Desktop Mode (X11 enabled) may work but untested

#### USAGE:   
Clone into your openFrameworks/addons folder
Either copy one of the examples into /myApps or add ofxRPiCameraVideoGrabber to the addons.make file in your project

LED Toggling requires gpio program provided via wiringPi   
`$sudo apt-get install wiringpi`


The addon works in a few different modes:

##### TEXTURE MODE:   
Allows the use of:
 - Shaders
 - Pixel access
 - Overlays, etc
 
 
##### NON-TEXTURE MODE (or direct-to screen)   
In non-texture mode the camera is rendered directly to the screen. It typically looks a bit faster/cleaner but no other drawing operations can happen.


RECORDING:   
Recording is available in both texture and non-texture modes


#### EXAMPLES:   

##### example-demo-mode    
Shows different settings available to tweak the camera exposure, metering, cropping, zooming, filters, mirroring, white balance

##### example-direct-mode   
Camera turns on and is rendered full screen via OMX acceleration   
Press the "e" key to toggle through built in filters

##### example-direct-mode-transform
Demos cropping, alpha, mirroring of direct display (not camera)  

##### example-texture-mode  
Camera turns on and renders to a texture that is drawn at full screen and a scaled version   
Press the "e" key to toggle through built in filters   


##### example-shaders   
Basic shader usage with texture-mode  
Press the "e" key to toggle through built in filters 
Press the "s" key to toggle shader   

##### example-saved-settings:   
Alternative way to load a camera configuration through a text file

##### example-recording:   
Recording of video in texture or direct mode

##### example-wrapper:   
Drop-in replacement for ofVideoGrabber (texture-mode only)
